i_talk_1,"Developers want to say：Mode 1 was developed for GameJam, and I may update other modes in the future. As the time is only 7 days, the quality of Mode 1 is slightly poor. After GameJam ends, I will release a downloadable version with a save function. Please stay tuned","开发者想说：模式1是为了GameJam而开发的，后续我可能会更新其他模式，因为时间只有7天，所以模式1质量稍差，等GameJam结束，我会推出含有保存功能的可下载版本，敬请期待"
